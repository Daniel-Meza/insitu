# Contributing to Insitu

InSitu by itself is nothing more than a platform; its real utility comes when users implement and share their own filters for others to use. To get started with your own filter, please read through [FILTERS.md](FILTERS.md). To contribute directly to the InSitu project, such as fixing bugs in the user interface or implementing suggestions for the plugin system, please refer to the To-Do list.
